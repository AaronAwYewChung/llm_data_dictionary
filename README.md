# llm_data_dictionary
This project is a Python-based AI assistant that provides a natural language interface for querying a technical data dictionary. It securely connects to a Supabase backend to fetch schema context, then leverages the   Google Gemini API to understand and answer user questions about database tables, columns, and definitions.
